### Google Test
#### ... as git submodule
After hours of scouring the web, I ultimately attached Google Test as a submodule relied heavily on [ProGit](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2), especially [7.11 Git Tools - Submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules).  

There are lots of out-dated tutorials about CMake and Google Test.  As such, they have created a lot of [Cargo Cult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult) incantations that are impenetrable with the brain of a mere mortal.

#### ... plays well with CMake
