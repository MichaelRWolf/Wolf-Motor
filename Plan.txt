X 1) I assert I can flip flop text changes between us
X 3) Git fluency 

 2) CMake fluency

X  build fizz-buzz_app
X  build fizz-buzz_lib
X  build fizz-buzz_app linking to fizz-buzz_lib

->  build fizz-buzz_test (w/ google test) 
  build fizz-buzz_test(w/ google test)  linking to fizz-buzz_lib
  TEST list:
     1 -> "1"
     3 -> "fizz"
     6 -> "fizz"
     5 -> "buzz"
     15 -> "fizz buzz"
    -1 -> ""
     



fizz-buzz_main executable

   application can exit 17
   can create fizz_buzz library w/ exit-19 function
   can link to library exit 19
   test_harness can exercise exit_19
   test_harness can link to library and return "fizzer"


  
 

4) Google test fluency

6) Motions

Mac rules.
Windows drools.
